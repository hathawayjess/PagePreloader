#Page Preloader

Based off of Codrops tutorial found here - http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/08/05/page-preloading-effect/


This is a page preloading effect made with CSS animations, SVG, and JavaScript.

*Inline SVGs* are used so we can style their paths in CSS. 
I made the DevMountain logo by converting it to .svg and exporting its path using [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/).


##Resources:

[CSS Animations](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) - allows element to gradually change from one style to another (see also: [@keyframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes))
[translate3d()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/translate3d) - moves position of element in 3d space

####SVG
[SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) - markup language for describing vector graphics (SVG is to graphics what HTML is to text)
